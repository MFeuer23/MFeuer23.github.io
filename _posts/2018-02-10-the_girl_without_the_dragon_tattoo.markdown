I've wanted to learn web and software development for some time now. Unsure where to begin and completely intimidated, I found some online resources and eventually Flatiron School. Reimagining myself as a woman in tech has been more fun and exciting than I would have imagined. It already feels like I'm getting into the flow of it- building, testing, struggling, that amazing moment when I figure it out! AHA! It's surprising how quickly the time seems to go. The Flatiron School community has been tremendously helpful and supportive so far, and I am becoming more excited than I am indimidated to be learning new things every day. As a musician and a creative person, I feel like I could really find happiness in a new career that challenges me to make stuff and solve problems. Looking forward to that day!
